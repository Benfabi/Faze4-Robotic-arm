# Forearm

Before you start, make sure you got the material and 3D prints below ready.

## Bill of Material

| Part | Quantity |
| ---- | -------- |
| M2 8mm screws | 2 |
| M3 20 mm screws | 8 |
| M3 30 mm screw | 8 |
| M5 HEX 20 mm screw | 7 |
| M5 HEX 30 mm screw | 5 |
| Ball bearing 35x47x7 | 1 |
| Micro limit switch | 1 |


## 3D prints

With the given GCode, there is a total of 2d 3h 30m of printing choosing the combined print.

| STL File | Quantity | 3mf File | gcode |
| -------- | -------- | -------- | ----- |
| Fork | 1 | - | - |
| Fork Motor | 1 | - | - |
| Fork wires | 1 | - | - |
| Joint 3 limit trigger | 1 | - | - |


For the ones who think that are too many prints, we combined the fast prints and get a total of 3 prints and a total print time of 2d 3h 30m.

| Combined file | 3mf File | gcode |
