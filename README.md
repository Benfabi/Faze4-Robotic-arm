Faze4 is small fully 3d printable Open source 6 axis robotic arm. It is functionally and esthetically similar to robotic arms in industry but is aimed for research, education and  anyone interested in making his own robot arm. 

The whole arm has around 1000 parts (including screws and bearings) and weights around 15 kg.

## Why this fork?

The original repository contains many links, PDFs and most likely everyhting you need to create the Faze4 robot. However, it does not really give a sense of a structured approach building it, writing software for the robot or using it in the end.

At this point, this fork is supposed to contribute. It should give a clear direction where to start and how to build it, independent of your background.

# Structure of this repo

- [0-Construction](./0-Construction): this folder contains a step by tutorial building the robot.
- [STL](./STL): this folder contains the STL files to print. The construction tutorial will let you know when each print is needed. 
- [Original](./Original): this folder contains the files from the original repository.

# Where to start ? 

It is recommended to start with the [Construction](./0-Construction) folder.
