# Construction

The construction of the Faze4 is structured in different stages.
At every stage, there is a list of tests provided that can be done in order to ensure correct functionality.

Every build stage consists of:
- Name and Tutorial.
- Bill of Materials (BoM) for the stage.
- List of 3D prints needed to complete the stage.
- Test cases ensuring correct assembly.

There are the following build stages (*work in progress*):
| Name | BoM | 3D Prints | Tests |
| ---- | --- | --------- | ----- |
| [Wrist](./a_Wrist.md) | [BoM](./a_Wrist.md#bill-of-material)  | [X h of printing](./a_Wrist.md#3d-prints)   | [X Test Cases](./a_Wrist.md#testing)  |
