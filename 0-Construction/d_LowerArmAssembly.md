# Forearm

Before you start, make sure you got the material and 3D prints below ready.

## Bill of Material

| Part | Quantity |
| ---- | -------- |
| M3 15 mm set screw | 12 |
| M3 20mm-25mm screws | 6 |
| Joint 4 belt | 1 |

## 3D prints

With the given GCode, there is a total of 2d 3h 30m of printing choosing the combined print.

| STL File | Quantity | 3mf File | gcode |
| -------- | -------- | -------- | ----- |
| Joint 4 pulley 28 teeth | 1 | - | - |
| Joint 4 pulley 26 teeth | 1 | - | - |


For the ones who think that are too many prints, we combined the fast prints and get a total of 3 prints and a total print time of 2d 3h 30m.

| Combined file | 3mf File | gcode |
| -------- | -------- | ----- |
| Joint 4 Pulleys | [3mf](../STL/d_LowerArmAssembly/joint%204%20pulley.3mf) | [gcode PLA 1d11h42m](../STL/d_LowerArmAssembly/Joint%204%20pulley_0.2mm_PLA_MK3S_2h41m.zip) |
