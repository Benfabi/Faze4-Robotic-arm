# Construction

The construction of the Faze4 is structured as follows. We will start bottom up, working our way from the base plate to a gripper at the end.
At every stage, there is a list of tests provided that can be done in order to ensure correct functionality.

Every build stage consists of:
- Name and Tutorial.
- Bill of Materials (BoM) for the stage.
- List of 3D prints needed to complete the stage.
- Test cases ensuring correct assembly.

There are the following build stages (*work in progress*):
| Name | BoM | 3D Prints | Tests |
| ---- | --- | --------- | ----- |
| [Base](https://github.com/Benfabi/Faze4-Robotic-arm/tree/master/0-Construction/a_Base.md) | XX  | A, B, C   | TEST  |
