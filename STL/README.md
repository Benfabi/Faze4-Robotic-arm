# STL files

This folder contains the STL files that are needed to build the robot. 
I also put the GCode files here that I used to print the specific parts.

The printer I use is a [Original Prusa i3 MK3S+ Drucker
](https://shop.prusa3d.com/3d-drucker/181-original-prusa-i3-mk3s-drucker.html).

The slicer settings used are in the corresponding 3mf file.
